Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

Node.js (LTS version recommended)

npm (comes with Node.js) or Yarn

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/lens-mind-app.git
cd lens-mind-app

(Note: Replace https://github.com/your-username/lens-mind-app.git with your actual repository URL once you create it.)

Install dependencies:

npm install
# or
yarn install

Running the App Locally
To run the app in development mode:

npm start
# or
yarn start

This will open the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Building for Production
To build the app for production to the build folder:

npm run build
# or
yarn build

This command bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

Deployment
The build folder contains the static assets ready for deployment. You can deploy this to any static hosting service like:

GitHub Pages

Netlify

Vercel

Firebase Hosting

Amazon S3

For GitHub Pages:

Ensure your package.json has a homepage field pointing to your GitHub Pages URL (e.g., "homepage": "https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name").

Install gh-pages:

npm install --save-dev gh-pages
# or
yarn add --dev gh-pages

Add the following scripts to your package.json:

"scripts": {
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
}

Run the deploy script:

npm run deploy
# or
yarn deploy

This will push the contents of your build directory to the gh-pages branch of your repository.
